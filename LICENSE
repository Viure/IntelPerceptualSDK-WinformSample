Annotation 1: Yes you can use this project for your Intel Challenge submission
and/or personal project!

Annotation 2: Note that the license allows you do what you want with this project,
however some parts of the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK are under a different
license so some things (like reverse engineering the library) and other "weird"
things are probably not allowed. In other words just because this project is
MIT Licensed it does not mean that the library used is also MIT Licensed.
